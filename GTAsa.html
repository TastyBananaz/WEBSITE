  <h2>Grand Theft Auto San Andreas</h2>
  <p>Carl Johnson (CJ) was born and raised in Grove Street, Ganton, Los Santos, sharing a house with his mother Beverly, brothers Sean ("Sweet") and Brian and sister Kendl. Sweet, CJ and their friends, Melvin Harris ("Big Smoke") and Lance Wilson ("Ryder") joined the Grove Street Families gang as children, with Sweet working his way up the ranks to become the gang's leader, whilst Carl became the underboss and Big Smoke and Ryder became high-ranking lieutenants. The Grove Street Families gained power in Los Santos, fighting with the Ballas and Vagos for control of the streets.</p>
  <p>Carl begins working with Sweet, Smoke, and Ryder to restore their gang in power. At first, he does small jobs, such as spraying enemy gang tags, clearing the hood of crack dealers, buying weapons from Emmet, and performing drive-bys in Ballas territory. Eventually, he moves on to some bigger operations, such as stealing weapons for fellow gang members from various sources across Los Santos alongside Ryder, and accompanying Big Smoke on several deals. During this time, CJ also reunites with another friend and occasional gang member OG Loc, who was just released from prison and asks for his help in killing his former cellmate. Afterwards, CJ helps OG Loc make a name of himself in the rapping industry by stealing some equipment from a beach party, as well as the rhyme book of famous rapper Madd Dogg, and killing Dogg's manager. While attending a house party hosted by OG Loc, several Ballas attack Grove Street, but CJ and Sweet are able to fend them off.</p>
  <p>With the Ballas severely weakened, Sweet decides it's time for Grove Street to regain control of Los Santos and plans to ambush a major group of Ballas under the Mulholland Intersection to end the gang war. Before he can join his brother on the attack, however, CJ is called by Cesar, who asks to meet him in Verdant Bluffs. There, Cesar reveals that he had been investigating the drive-by shooting that killed Beverly and learned it was meant for Sweet. Just then, the pair spot Big Smoke, Ryder, C.R.A.S.H. and some Ballas exiting a garage containing a green Sabre, the same car used in the drive-by. This makes CJ realize that Big Smoke and Ryder have sold out Grove Street to the Ballas and have been working with C.R.A.S.H., as well as they were the ones who organized the drive-by, in an attempt to kill Sweet and wipe out the gang. CJ then also concludes that Sweet must be headed into a trap and goes to save him, only to find him severely injured. Sweet orders Carl to leave, but Carl refuses and kills several waves of Ballas. However, the police soon arrive and arrest both Sweet and Carl. Sweet is taken to a prison hospital, whilst Carl is driven by C.R.A.S.H. outside of Los Santos, to the small town of Angel Pine, in the countryside area of Whetstone.</p>
  <p>CJ found out Big Smoke has joined the Ballas and has betrayed the family so The Johnson brothers head to Smoke's crack palace to kill him for his betrayal of the gang, but CJ apologizes to Sweet and convinces to let him deal with Smoke on his own, to make up for all his mistakes. Fighting his way through the fortress, Carl eventually confronts Big Smoke and attempts to reason with him, but he opens fire on CJ. In the ensuing firefight, Carl fatally shoots Smoke, who admits to having betrayed the gang for money and proclaims that "Everybody will remember my name! Big Smoke!", before dying. As Carl sadly laments Smoke's death, claiming it was a "waste", Tenpenny arrives to collect his share of Smoke's money from the drug trade and hold Carl at gunpoint to load the money into his briefcase, intending to use it to flee the city. He then attempts to kill Carl, but he survives. Tenpenny then attempts to escape in a stolen firetruck, but Sweet grabs hold of the truck's ladder. Carl follows them in a car, and manages to catch Sweet when he loses his grip. The brothers then pursue Tenpenny together, with Sweet taking the wheel, while Carl shoots at pursuing police officers and rioting gang members. Tenpenny soon loses control of the firetruck and crashes off the bridge over Grove Street. After claiming that he "cleaned up the streets", Tenpenny finally dies, as CJ, his friends and family watch. The Truth congratulates Carl on "beating the system", before they head into the Johnson house to celebrate.</p>
